Thomas Paine wrote in COMMON SENSE:


Government by kings was first introduced into the world by the
Heathens, from whom the children of Israel copied the custom. It was
the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the
promotion of idolatry. The Heathens paid divine honors to their
deceased kings, and the Christian world hath improved on the plan by
doing the same to their living ones.

How impious is the title of sacred majesty applied to a worm, who in
the midst of his splendor is crumbling into dust!

As the exalting one man so greatly above the rest cannot be
justified on the equal rights of nature, so neither can it be
defended on the authority of scripture; for the will of the
Almighty, as declared by Gideon and the prophet Samuel, expressly
disapproves of government by kings.

All anti-monarchial parts of scripture have been very smoothly
glossed over in monarchial governments, but they undoubtedly merit
the attention of countries which have their governments yet to form.
Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's is the scriptural
doctrine of courts, yet it is no support of monarchial government,
for the Jews at that time were without a king, and in a state of
vassalage to the Romans.

Near three thousand years passed away from the Mosaic account of the
creation, till the Jews under a national delusion requested a king.
Till then their form of government (except in extraordinary cases,
where the Almighty interposed) was a kind of republic administered
by a judge and the elders of the tribes. Kings they had none, and it
was held sinful to acknowledge any being under that title but the
Lords of Hosts.

And when a man seriously reflects on the idolatrous homage which is
paid to the persons of kings he need not wonder, that the Almighty,
ever jealous of his honor, should disapprove of a form of government
which so impiously invades the prerogative of heaven.
...
The children of Israel being oppressed by the Midianites, Gideon
marched against them with a small army, and victory, through the
divine interposition, decided in his favor. The Jews, elate with
success, and attributing it to the generalship of Gideon, proposed
making him a king, saying, "Rule thou over us, thou and thy son and
thy son's son."

Here was temptation in its fullest extent; not a kingdom only, but
an hereditary one, but Gideon in the piety of his soul replied, "I
will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you, THE LORD
SHALL RULE OVER YOU."

Words need not be more explicit; Gideon doth not decline the honor
but denies their right to give it; neither doth he compliment them
with invented declarations of his thanks, but in the positive style
of a prophet charges them with disaffection to their proper
sovereign, the King of Heaven.

About one hundred and thirty years after this, they fell again into
the same error. The hankering which the Jews had for the idolatrous
customs of the Heathens, is something exceedingly unaccountable; but
so it was, that laying hold of the misconduct of Samuel's two sons,
who were entrusted with some secular concerns, they came in an
abrupt and clamorous manner to Samuel, saying, "Behold thou art old
and thy sons walk not in thy ways, now make us a king to judge us
like all the other nations."

And here we cannot but observe that their motives were bad, viz.,
that they might be like unto other nations, i.e., the Heathen,
whereas their true glory laid in being as much unlike them as
possible. But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, give us a
king to judge us; and Samuel prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord said
unto Samuel, "Listen to the voice of the people in all that they say
to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me,
THEN I SHOULD NOT REIGN OVER THEM. According to all the works which
they have done since the day; wherewith they brought them up out of
Egypt, even unto this day; wherewith they have forsaken me and served
other Gods; so do they also unto you.

"Now therefore hearken unto their voice, howbeit, protest solemnly
unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over
them," i.e., not of any particular king, but the general manner of
the kings of the earth, whom Israel was so eagerly copying after.
And notwithstanding the great distance of time and difference of
manners, the character is still in fashion.

And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people, that
asked of him a king. And he said, "This shall be the manner of the
king that shall reign over you:

"He will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his
chariots, and to be his horsemen, and some shall run before his
chariots [this description agrees with the present mode of
impressing men] and he will appoint him captains over thousands and
captains over fifties, and will set them to ear his ground and to
reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
instruments of his chariots; and he will take your daughters to be
confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers [this describes the
expense and luxury as well as the oppression of kings] and he will
take your fields and your olive yards, even the best of them, and
give them to his servants; and he will take the tenth of your seed,
and of your vineyards, and give them to his officers and to his
servants [by which we see that bribery, corruption, and favoritism
are the standing vices of kings] and he will take the tenth of your
men servants, and your maid servants, and your goodliest young men
and your asses, and put them to his work; and he will take the tenth
of your sheep, ---and ye shall be his servants--- and ye shall cry
out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen, AND
THE LORD WILL NOT HEAR YOU IN THAT DAY."

This accounts for the continuation of monarchy; neither do the
characters of the few good kings which have lived since, either
sanctify the title, or blot out the sinfulness of the origin; the
high encomium given of David takes no notice of him officially as a
king, but only as a man after God's own heart.

Nevertheless the People refused to obey the voice of Samuel, and
they said, "Nay, but we will have a king over us, that we may be like
all the nations, and that our king may judge us, and go out before
us and fight our battles."

Samuel continued to reason with them, but to no purpose; he set
before them their ingratitude, but all would not avail; and seeing
them fully bent on their folly, he cried out, "I will call unto the
Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain [which then was a
punishment, being the time of wheat harvest] that ye may perceive
and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the
sight of the Lord, IN ASKING YOU A KING."

So Samuel called unto the Lord, and the Lord sent thunder and rain
that day, and all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. And
all the people said unto Samuel, "Pray for thy servants unto the Lord
thy God that we die not, for WE HAVE ADDED UNTO OUR SINS THIS EVIL,
TO ASK A KING."

These portions of scripture are direct and positive. They admit of
no equivocal construction. That the Almighty hath here entered his
protest against monarchial government is true, or the scripture is
false. And a man hath good reason to believe that there is as much
of kingcraft, as priestcraft in withholding the scripture from the
public in Popish countries. For monarchy in every instance is the
Popery of government.

HONORABLE MENTIONS

It seems appropriate to mention a few other people who deserve mentioning.

A moment of silence for "Jolly Good Fellow" Bernard von NotHaus,
the founder of NORFED who was recently (and wrongfully) convicted of
"domestic terrorism."

For history, I will reproduce a few gloating FBI quotes:

"Attempts to undermine the legitimate currency of this country
are simply a unique form of domestic terrorism."
...
"We are determined to meet these threats through infiltration,
disruption, and dismantling of organizations which seek to challenge
the legitimacy of our democratic form of government."
...
"While these forms of anti-government activities do not involve
violence, they are every bit as insidious and represent a clear and
present danger to the economic stability of this country."

// -----------------------------------------------

Speaking of wrongful prosecution...

Tip of the hat to Dr. Douglas Jackson for his sacrifices and
accomplishments.
May this software protect future innovators from persecution,
in a diversity of jurisdictions.

Aaron Swartz, in the depths of depression, was driven to suicide by
unfair prosecution. He didn't beat, rob, or murder anyone. He was
someone who fought for the good of all mankind. His girlfriend,
Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, said of him:

"I've never met anyone so single-minded about changing the world."
